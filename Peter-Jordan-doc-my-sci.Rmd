## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r perform-math }
# perform addition
a <- 1+2

b <- 234

# subtract a from b
final_answer <- b - a

# write out the final answer variable
final_answer

```
```{r math-part-two }

   # More math!
   a * b

   a * b / final_answer
   
```  
```{r testing-arguments, eval = FALSE }

   # Show the code, but not the output.
   a * b

   a * b / final_answer

```
 
```{r testing-arguments1, echo=FALSE }

    # Hide the code, but show the output. Useful for creating a report with plots where you have a lot of code generating those plots.
     a * b
    a * b

    a * b / final_answer
```

```{r testing-arguments2, results="hide" }

     # The code will be evaluated but the results or the code will not be rendered on the output document.

     a * b / final_answer

```

```{r}
# load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# download data from figshare
# note that we are downloading  the data into your working directory (earth-analytics)
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7010681",
              destfile = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# import data
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file="data/boulder-precip.csv")

# view first few rows of the data
head(boulder_precip)

# when we download the data we create a dataframe
# view each column of the data frame using it's name (or header)
boulder_precip$DATE

# view the precip column
boulder_precip$PRECIP

# q plot stands for quick plot. Let's use it to plot our data
qplot(x=boulder_precip$DATE,
      y=boulder_precip$PRECIP)

```
```{r}
getwd()
